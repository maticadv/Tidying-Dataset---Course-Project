# Codebook:

There are 81 columns in the new data set, each representing a particular computed mean of measured values.
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
The columns starting with time represent the mean of the time in which the event occurred, measured at a constant rate of 50Hz.
The columns starting with frequency represent the mean of the values on which a FFT was applied, so they are signals in the frequency domain.
The data are collected from an accelerometer and a gyroscope, in the three directions x, y, and z.
The accelerations by body and gravity are split in different variables.
The body linear acceleration and angular velocity are derived to obtain jerk signals.
The magnitudes of these signals are calculated using Euclidean Norm.
Of all the data contained in the original dataset, only mean and std values are used. The presence of meanfrequency means that this frequency is a weighted average of the frequency components. The last two columns are the activity and the subject who did it.

For example, frequencybodyaccelerometerjerksignalmeanfrequencydirectiony is the mean of all the weighted averages of the frequency components of the jerk signals of the FTT of the body acceleration in direction Y (coming from the accelerometer).

Another easier example, timebodygyroscopestddirectionx is the mean of all the standard deviations in the body measurements of the gyroscope in direction X.
